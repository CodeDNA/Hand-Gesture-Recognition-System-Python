# Machine Learning
Machine Learning Project. Hand Gesture Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network

# Instructions to run the script
1) Open the script in your preferred IDE.
2) Install Python (version 3.7) as select it as your preferred interpreter. Install Keras and NumPy library.
3) Paste the image that you want to predict in the prediction_Image folder and rename it as "predict.jpg".
4) Run the script.

## Important: 
keep the 'dataset' folder,'prediction-Image' and 'Hand_Gesture_Classification.py' file in the same directory. Otherwise, you will have to edit the paths in the code for 'training_set', 'test_set' and 'image' variable.
